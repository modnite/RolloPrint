## What RolloPrint Does

- **Direct USB Printing**: Plug your Android device into the Rollo printer via USB OTG or a USB-C dock to print 4x6 labels instantly.
- **Built-in Network Print Server**: Toggle on the Print Server, and any Mac, Windows, Linux PC, or mobile device on the local Wi-Fi network can discover the printer automatically via AirPrint / IPP.
- **WhatsApp & File Share Support**: Tap "Share" on any PDF label in WhatsApp or your file manager, select RolloPrint, preview it, and print.
- **Auto-Formatting for 4x6 Thermal Labels**: Automatically converts PDFs, images, or text into crisp 4" x 6" 203 DPI monochrome shipping labels.
- **Samsung DeX & Phone Friendly**: Fully aware of display cutouts (camera notches) on phones and scales naturally in Samsung DeX desktop mode.
- **Auto Hardware Detection**: Detects when the Rollo printer is plugged in and prompts for connection permissions automatically.

## How It Works

```
[ PDF Label / Network Job ] ➔ [ 816x1218 Canvas (4x6 @ 203 DPI) ]
                                             │
                                             ▼
[ Rollo USB Hardware ] ◄── [ USB Bulk Stream ] ◄── [ TSPL Command Stream ]
```

1. **Input**: A PDF label is selected manually, shared from WhatsApp, or sent over the local Wi-Fi network.
2. **Render**: The document is formatted and scaled onto an 816 × 1218 pixel canvas matching 4x6 inches at 203 DPI.
3. **Convert**: Pixel luminance is packed into 1-bit monochrome bytes with polarity calibrated specifically for Rollo thermal heads.
4. **Stream**: The TSPL command stream is sent directly to the printer over the USB OTG connection.
